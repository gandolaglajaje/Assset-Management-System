# Asset Management System

## Overview
The **Asset Management System** is a **model-driven app** designed to streamline asset tracking and management. Integrated with **Power Automate**, it automates workflows, and features an **embedded Power BI dashboard** for real-time analytics and reporting.

## Key Features

**Note**: This application highlights my skills in **Power Apps**, **Power Automate**, and **Power BI**, demonstrating my ability to integrate these tools for efficient business solutions. It is inspired by the **Power Apps Model-Driven Apps Full Course** by **Lisa Crosbie**.
